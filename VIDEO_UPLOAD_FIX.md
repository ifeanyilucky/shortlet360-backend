# Video Upload Fix Documentation

## Problem
The video upload functionality was failing with the error:
```
{"success":false,"message":"All video uploads failed","urls":[]}
```

The specific error from Cloudinary was:
```
Video is too large to process synchronously, please use an eager transformation with eager_async=true to resolve
```

## Root Cause
1. **Configuration Issue**: Environment variables for Cloudinary were duplicated and inconsistent
2. **Synchronous Processing**: Large videos (>30MB) were being processed synchronously, causing timeouts
3. **Missing Error Handling**: Generic error messages made debugging difficult
4. **Insufficient Validation**: File type and size validation was not comprehensive

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Environment Configuration
- Updated `.env` file to use consistent variable names
- Removed duplicate Cloudinary configuration entries

### 2. Enhanced Video Upload Handling
The system now handles videos based on size:

- **Small videos (<10MB)**: Use synchronous transformations
- **Medium videos (10-30MB)**: Use asynchronous processing with `eager_async=true`
- **Large videos (>30MB)**: Skip transformations to avoid sync processing issues
- **Very large videos (>50MB)**: Use `upload_large` method

### 3. Improved Error Logging
- Added detailed error logging in `utils/cloudinary.js`
- Enhanced error messages in upload routes
- Added file size and type information to error logs

### 4. Better File Validation
- Added comprehensive MIME type validation
- Implemented file size checks before upload
- Added support for common video formats: MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WebM, MKV

## Files Modified

1. **`.env`** - Fixed Cloudinary configuration
2. **`utils/cloudinary.js`** - Enhanced upload logic and error handling
3. **`routes/uploadRoutes.js`** - Improved validation and error logging
4. **`test-video-upload.js`** - Created debug test script

## Testing

Run the test script to verify configuration:
```bash
node test-video-upload.js
```

## Upload Endpoints

- **Single video**: `POST /api/v1/upload/video/single`
- **Multiple videos**: `POST /api/v1/upload/video/multiple`

## File Limits

- Maximum file size: 100MB per video
- Supported formats: MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WebM, MKV
- Maximum files per request: 5 videos

## Error Handling

The system now provides detailed error information:
- File size validation errors
- MIME type validation errors
- Cloudinary-specific errors with codes
- Upload timeout information

## Monitoring

Check server logs for detailed upload information:
- File sizes and types being processed
- Upload method being used (sync/async/upload_large)
- Detailed error messages with Cloudinary error codes

## Next Steps

1. Test with actual video files of various sizes
2. Monitor server logs during uploads
3. Adjust size thresholds if needed based on performance
4. Consider implementing progress tracking for large uploads
